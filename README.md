<h1>Smoothing Splines for Bitcoin Prices</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

In this project, I implemented a linear spline, cubic spline, B-spline, GCV based penalized spline, and a natural cubic spline to Bitcoin Prices across two different time frames. Specifically in the presentation it was over May 2, 2021 to July 5, 2021 and within my R code I first go over my implementations into Bitcoin prices over Febuary 4, 2018 to Febuary 7, 2018. Both time frames utilize hourly data. Modeling Bitcoin Prices against different lengths in time frame provided an interesting result in how indentification of techincal analysis could be validated. This project was based upon the paper "Identification of Technical Analysis Patterns with Smoothing Splines for Bitcoin Prices" written by Nikolay Miller, Yiming Yang, Bruce Sun, and Guoyi Zhang. In addition to my own finding I give an overview in my presentation linked above. All R-Code is oringal and provided above.
